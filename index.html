            <img class="auth-image" src="assets/images/cfa.jpg" alt="Guy wearing a Chick-fil-A shirt and laughing" />
            <p>
                Just an ordinary guy from Cairo, Georgia doing extraordinary things. Football was my life from age 5 to
                age 24.
                I can't not express enough gratitude towards the sport that evolved me into the person I am today. I've
                battled
                hardships, from tearing my ACL in college to being diagnosed with sleep apnea. However, I wake up every
                day ready
                to battle whatever obstacles that may arise.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a lighter note, I enjoy weightlifting, creating graphic desgins, and playing video games (Xbox). If
                you would
                like to add me as a friend on Xbox, my gamertag is DeuceLafetti. Anyways, I received my undergraduate
                degree in
                Computer Science at the University of the South and earned a MBA from Berry College. Currently, I work
                at Chick-fil-A
                Inc. as an IT Analyst. </p>

            <p>With much interest in automation, I am looking to learn as much as I can to better serve
                the industry. Feel free to roam around and check out my portfolio!
